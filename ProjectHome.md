ECO is an Open Source software that allows you to set up live videoconferences in the web for virtual classroom.

It has four enssetial components:

eco.profesor - A Java Application running on the profesor's pc that can handle all the webcams connected and screencast. The profesor only has to decide what he want to transmit.

eco.classroom (server) - A Java application that works as a channel to communicate with the teacher and the student, keeping track of subscriptions, publications, etc.

eco.student - An application that allows students access to lectures by the professor from your mobile device.

At last you will need a media server that supports flv formats and RTMP live streaming. It works great with red5. Check http://www.red5.org/
